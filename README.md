## How to Use (3 Easy Steps)

1. **Be in a voice channel**
2. **Type in chat:** /record start > Optional: pick a text channel → `target_channel: #your_text_channel_from_discord_server`
3. **To stop:** /record stop > Or just leave the voice channel - it stops itself!

## Where Do Recordings Go?

- **Default:** The **server’s configured default recordings channel** (set by Discord Server's admins)
- **Custom:** Choose any text channel when starting: /record start target_channel: #meeting-notes (for example)
 
---

> **Bot needs permissions** in the text and voice channels:  
> 'Connect', 'Speak', 'Send Messages', 'Attach Files'

---

## Privacy & Consent (We Take This Seriously)

> **Recording only with everyone’s consent!**  
> The bot **always announces** out loud: *"This meeting is being recorded"*

- Files are **deleted immediately after upload**
- No data sent to third parties
