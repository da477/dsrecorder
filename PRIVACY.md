# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how **Record Bot** ("the Bot", "we", "us") collects, uses, and handles information when you use the bot in your Discord server.

---

## What We Collect

- **Voice recordings**: Audio is captured **only** when a user explicitly starts a recording using `/record start`.
- **No personal data** is stored beyond what is strictly necessary for bot operation (e.g., channel IDs, session metadata).

> We do **not** collect names, messages, or user behavior outside of active recording sessions.

---

## How We Use the Data

- Recordings are processed into audio files (WAV → Opus) and uploaded to the **designated text channel** on your server.
- Temporary metadata (channel ID, session ID, timestamp) is used to route files correctly and ensure reliable operation.

---

## Data Retention

- Recordings are **stored temporarily** on the bot’s server.
- Files are **deleted immediately after successful upload**.
- If upload fails, files are deleted within **1 hour**.

---

## Sharing & Third Parties

- We do **not** share recordings with anyone except:
    - Uploading to the **text channel you configured**
    - As required by law (e.g., valid legal request)
- No data is sold, shared with advertisers, or used for analytics.

---

## Your Responsibilities

> **You must obtain explicit consent** from **all participants** before recording.  
> The bot announces *"This meeting is being recorded"* aloud, but **it does not collect or verify consent**.

You are solely responsible for:
- Complying with local recording laws
- How recordings are stored, shared, or used after upload
